## Test 1

Drone A is at the [south side of the Golden Gate Bridge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B048'35.1%22N+122%C2%B028'38.6%22W/@37.8097431,-122.4779472,255m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d37.809742!4d-122.4774) (37.809750, -122.477389) and headed to the [north side](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B049'49.2%22N+122%C2%B028'47.3%22W/@37.8303329,-122.4813152,704m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d37.83033!4d-122.479802) (37.830333, -122.479806) at 45 miles per hour (20.1168 meters per second). Drone A stays 35 feet above the roadway so its altitude is 77.724 meters.

Drone B is on the [bay side of the bridge](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B049'10.5%22N+122%C2%B028'34.2%22W/@37.8195912,-122.4783407,1019m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d37.819587!4d-122.476152) (37.819587, -122.476152) and holding 55 meters above the  water.

When does Drone A come closest to Drone B?

First we convert the start position of drone A into a p-vector. I wrote a little program in python to do this. To run it, put this in your terminal:

```bsh
python3 pvector.py 37.809750 -122.477389 77.724
```

The output should be:
```csv
-2709246.236680999863892793655395507812500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,-4256370.540216220542788505554199218750000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,3888829.846566714812070131301879882812500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

to find the velocity of drone A, I wrote another python program that takes the start position, the end position, and the speed:

```bsh
python3 velocity.py 37.809750 -122.477389 77.724 37.830333 -122.479806 77.724 20.1168
```
The output should be:
```csv
5.021322839493915779485178063623607158660888671875000000000000,11.363008759244467071880535513628274202346801757812500000000000,15.822578523076142431591506465338170528411865234375000000000000
```

We need to convert the position of drone B into a p-vector. We can use the same program:

```bsh
python3 pvector.py 37.819583 -122.476167 55
```

You should see this output:
```csv
-2708786.517620196565985679626464843750000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,-4255848.671836916357278823852539062500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,3889678.122368189040571451187133789062500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

The velocity of drone B in this case is
```csv
0,0,0
```

Now we can create a line in our test file where we combine the output of all the csv data above:
