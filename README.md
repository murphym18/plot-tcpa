## Getting the dependencies installed
I am on a debian-like distro of linux and I installed these libs:
- python3-numpy
- python3-matplotlib
- python3-tk

There are probably better ways to setup the project to make getting these libs easier, but for me this works:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-tk python3-matplotlib
```

## How to run the program

Put this in your terminal:
```bash
python3 dist.py
```
